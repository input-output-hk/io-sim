-- | This class is for abstracting over 'stToIO' which allows running 'ST'
-- actions in 'IO'. In this case it is to allow running 'ST' actions within
-- another monad @m@.
--
-- The normal type of 'stToIO' is:
--
-- > stToIO :: ST RealWorld a -> IO a
--
-- We have two approaches to abstracting over this, a new and an older
-- (deprecated) method. The new method borrows the @primitive@ package's
-- 'PrimMonad' and 'PrimState' type family. This gives us:
--
-- > stToIO :: ST (PrimState m) a -> m a
--
-- Which for 'IO' is exactly the same as above. For 'ST' it is identity, while
-- for @IOSim@ it is
--
-- > stToIO :: ST s a -> IOSim s a
--
-- The older (deprecated) method is tricky because we need to not care about
-- both the @IO@, and also the @RealWorld@, and it does so avoiding mentioning
-- any @s@ type (which is what the 'PrimState' type family gives access to).
-- The solution is to write an action that is given the @liftST@ as an argument
-- and where that action itself is polymorphic in the @s@ parameter. This
-- allows us to instantiate it with @RealWorld@ in the @IO@ case, and the local
-- @s@ in a case where we are embedding into another @ST@ action.
