# [`io-sim`]

[`IOSim`] is a simulator monad that supports:

* asynchronous exceptions
* simulated time
* timeout API
* software transaction memory (STM)
* concurrency: both low-level `forkIO` as well as `async` style
* strict STM
* access to lazy ST
* schedule discovery (see [IOSimPOR][io-sim-por-how-to])
* event log
* dynamic tracing
* tracing committed changes to `TVar`, `TMVar`s, etc.
* labeling of threads, `TVar`'s, etc.

[`io-classes:io-classes`] provides an interface, which allows writing code that
can be run in both real `IO` and [`IOSim`].  It is a drop-in replacement for
`IO`, and supports interfaces commonly known from `base`, `exceptions`, `stm`,
`async`, or `time` packages.

One of the principles of `io-classes:io-classes` was to stay as close to `IO`
as possible, thus most of the `IO` instances are directly referring to `base`
or `async` API.  However, we made some distinctions, which are reported below.

[`io-classes:io-classes`] supports a novel hierarchy for error-handling monads
as well as more familiar `exception` style.  The new hierarchy provides
`bracket` and `finally` functions in the `MonadThrow` class, while `catch`
style operators are provided by a super-class `MonadCatch`.  Both `bracket` and
`finally` are the most common functions used to write code with robust
exception handling, exposing them through the more basic `MonadThrow` class
informs the reader / reviewer that no tricky error handling is done in that
section of the code base.

[`IOSim`] exposes a detailed trace, which can be enhanced by labeling threads, or
mutable variables, tracing `Dynamic` values (which can be recovered from the
trace), or simple `String` based tracing.  Although it's agnostic concerning
the logging framework, it worked for us particularly well using
[contra-tracer][contra-tracer].  It has been used to develop, test, and debug
a complex, highly concurrent, distributed system
([ouroboros-network][ouroboros-network]), in particular

* write network simulations, to verify a complex networking stack;
* write disk IO simulations, to verify a database implementation.

## Packages

* [`io-sim`]: provides two simulator interpreters: [`IOSim`] and
  `IOSimPOR` - an enhanced [`IOSim`] version with schedule discovery
  capabilities.
* [`io-classes:io-classes`]: class bases interface, which allows to to abstract over the
    monad
* [`io-classes:strict-stm`]: strict STM operations
* [`io-classes:si-timers`]: non-standard timers API
