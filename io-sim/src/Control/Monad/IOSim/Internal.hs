-- | This function receives a list of TimerTimeout values that represent threads

-- This function is responsible for the second part of the race condition issue
-- and relates to the 'schedule's 'TimeoutFrame' locking explanation (here is
-- where the assassin threads are launched. So, as explained previously, at this
-- point in code, the timeout expired so we need to interrupt the running
-- thread. If the running thread finished at the same time the timeout expired
-- we have a race condition. To deal with this race condition what we do is
-- look at the lock value. If it is 'Locked' this means that the running thread
-- already finished (or won the race) so we can safely do nothing. Otherwise, if
-- the lock value is 'NotLocked' we need to acquire the lock and launch an
-- assassin thread that is going to interrupt the running one. Note that we
-- should run this interrupting thread in an unmasked state since it might
-- receive a 'ThreadKilled' exception.
