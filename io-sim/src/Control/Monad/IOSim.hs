-- Extracting races from a trace.  There is a subtlety in doing so: we

-- example, if the system falls into a deterministic infinite loop,
-- then there will be no races to find.

-- In reality we only want to extract races from *the part of the
-- trace used in a test*. We can only observe that by tracking lazy
-- evaluation: only races that were found in the evaluated prefix of
-- an infinite trace should contribute to the "races found". Hence we
-- return a function that returns the races found "so far". This is
-- unsafe, of course, since that function may return different results
-- at different times.

-- | Detach discovered races.  This is written in `ST` monad to support
-- simulations which do not terminate, in which case we will only detach races
-- up to the point we evaluated the simulation.

-- IOSimPOR
--
--
-- $iosimpor
--
-- /IOSimPOR/ is a different interpreter of 'IOSim' which has the ability to
-- discover race conditions and replay the simulation using a schedule which
-- reverts them.  For extended documentation how to use it see
-- [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/blob/main/io-sim/how-to-use-IOSimPOR.md).
--
-- /IOSimPOR/ only discovers races between events which happen in the same time
-- slot.  In /IOSim/ and /IOSimPOR/ time only moves explicitly through timer
-- events, e.g. things like `Control.Monad.Class.MonadTimer.SI.threadDelay`,
-- `Control.Monad.Class.MonadTimer.SI.registerDelay` or the
-- `Control.Monad.Class.MonadTimer.NonStandard.MonadTimeout` API.  The usual
-- QuickCheck techniques can help explore different schedules of
-- threads too.

-- | Execute a simulation, discover & revert races.  Note that this will execute
-- the simulation multiple times with different schedules, and thus it's much
-- more costly than a simple `runSimTrace` (also the simulation environments has
-- much more state to track and hence is slower).
--
-- On property failure it will show the failing schedule (`ScheduleControl`)
-- which can be plugged to `controlSimTrace`.
--
-- Note: `exploreSimTrace` evaluates each schedule in parallel (using `par`).

-- compareTraces is given (maybe) a passing trace and a failing trace,
-- and identifies the point at which they diverge, where it inserts a
-- "sleep" event for the thread that is delayed in the failing case,
-- and a "wake" event before its next action. It also returns the
-- identity and time of the sleeping thread. Since we expect the trace
-- to be consumed lazily (and perhaps only partially), and since the
-- sleeping thread is not of interest unless the trace is consumed
-- this far, then we collect its identity only if it is reached using
-- unsafePerformIO.
